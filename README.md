#### Abstract

Congestion in Malaysia’s toll plazas has prompted exploring various solutions, from infrastructure improvements to advanced technologies. Enhancing toll plaza infrastructure, such as constructing additional tollbooths and widening lanes while implementing electronic toll collection systems, has had some positive impacts. However, these existing measures have faced limitations in effectively addressing congestion. The use of multiclass toll lanes, still applied manual vehicle classification which rely on human operators has yet to sufficiently overcome congestion, given the diverse vehicle types and toll rates. This situation leads to human error and affects traffic flow. Although RFID (Radio frequency identification) technology has been widely adopted at only a few toll lanes, challenges in implementation have led to congestion issues due to insufficient infrastructure and reliability problems. Therefore, the outcome of this project is to develop the best model detector of automated real-time multiclass vehicle classification for all lanes in toll plaza. This model input is extract from 1,735 images which consists of 7 class of vehicles and its annotated TXT and XML file respectively for one stage detector; Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), ResNet-50 and two stage detectors; You Only Look Once (YOLO), including YOLO-NAS and YOLOv8 Darknet-53. The classification model performs well in YOLOv8 architecture with the highest mean average precision (MAP-50) of 0.995 after fine-tuning.
